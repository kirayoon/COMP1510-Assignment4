You walk back to your cave with a full stomach, ready to sleep through the winter.
You see a small fire burning in the middle of the cave.
What's this?

It's Mama Lob.

She's seeking revenge for the death of her husband.
She's coming for you.
She has a gun... and bombs.

You have to fight her.

GOAL: Kill Mama Lob
